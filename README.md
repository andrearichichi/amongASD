# Algorithms and Data Structures 2022/2023

## Project Overview
This project is an educational initiative in algorithms and data structures, set in a university context. The key theme is applying graph algorithms in a playful, interactive scenario.

### Scenario
- **University as a Graph**: The university layout is conceptualized as a graph where rooms (nodes) are interconnected by corridors (edges).
- **Objective**: Students aim to find a hidden "BibbiaTM" in a specific room (FabLab) to pass their exam. Simultaneously, an impostor (professor) attempts to reach it first.
- **Challenge**: Navigate through the university graph, considering directional corridors and varying travel times affected by large fans, controlled by the professor.

### Key Tasks
- **Optimize Paths**: Develop algorithms to find the fastest routes for both the professor and students.
- **Variable Speeds**: Account for changing corridor speeds due to the professor's control over the environment.

### Educational Goals
The project fosters practical application of graph theory and algorithmic problem-solving, enhancing students' understanding of these key computer science concepts.
